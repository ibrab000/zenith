Introducing Zenith by Ibrahim and Duodeath, a layout that takes into consideration intentional alt-fingering, very high total rolls (specifically inrolls), most consonants on right side which benefits usage of right thumb spacing, and the goal of minimizing the amount of difficult words and letter pairings in the e200 wordlist, all in one layout.

Alt-fingering adjusted stats (for e200):
```
zenith
f o u r z p v j l d
y a i n c g s e h t

sfb: 0%
sfs: ~4%
roll: 64.03%
redirect: 4.68%
```
Notes On Alt-Fingering:
Zenith is flexible in terms of how you can alt-finger certain words but most are intuitive. Here are the SFBs on e200 that can be alted easily: turn RN, small SM, since NC, increase NCR

Some alt-fingerings consist of SFS: SFBs split by 1 or more character. In this case it usually requires you to move your hand into the center column, some Zenith examples:
‘give’ RI, LM, RM, RR
‘most’ RI, LR, RM, RP
‘since’ RI, LR, LM, LI, RM

You can also choose to type B with Left Thumb, Left Index, or Left Middle, depending on the word, examples:

‘problem’ B with LT or LI
‘about’ B with LT or LI
‘become’ B with LT or LM, then C with LI
